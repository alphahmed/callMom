# CallMom
Python script for calling mtDNA variants. DNA is maternally inherited, hence "Call Mom". Script takes as input a reference sequence, and a fasta file with individual mtDNA sequences. The script identifies variants with respect to the reference and outputs in VCF format. Calling includes SNPs, MNPs, and indels.

How to use:
./CallMom.VERSION.py REFERENCE INDIVIDUALS
Where
VERSION is the downloaded version of CallMom
The REFERENCE is a single fasta file, such a the rCRS (Cambridge Reference Sequence)
The INDIVIDUALS file has a series of fasta files in the format:

\>sample id
ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT

The sequence should be the same length as the reference, and all on a single line.
