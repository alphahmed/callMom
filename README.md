# CallMom
Python script for calling mtDNA variants. DNA is maternally inherited, hence "call Mom". Script takes as input a reference sequence, and a fasta file with individual mtDNA sequences. The script identifies variants with respect to the reference and outputs in VCF format. Calling includes SNPs, MNPs, and indels.
